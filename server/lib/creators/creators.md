# Creators

The creators use templates to generate files.
The files that are generated are:

- Database models
  > Files saved in: _/models_ > **Note:** The models the app needs to work correctly are stored in the **core** directory.
- Api routes
  > Files saved in: _router/api_

Both files are generated each time a new Content Type is created.
